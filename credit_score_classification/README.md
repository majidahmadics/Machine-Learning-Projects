# Credit Score Classification with Random Forest Classifier
This repository contains a Python script for credit score classification using the Random Forest Classifier. The script utilizes the popular libraries Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Plotly for data visualization.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-score-classification.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd credit-score-classification

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn

# Usage
Download the dataset:

Download the "train.csv" dataset and place it in the project directory.

Run the script:

python credit_score_classification.py

The script reads the dataset, performs exploratory data analysis using Plotly, and then builds a Random Forest Classifier to predict credit scores.

Input Features for Prediction:

The script will prompt you to enter specific features for making credit score predictions. Follow the instructions to input the required information.

# Visualizations
The script generates various box plots using Plotly to visualize the relationships between credit scores and different features, such as occupation, annual income, monthly inhand salary, number of bank accounts, etc.

# Model Training
The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the provided dataset to predict credit scores based on input features.

# Input and Prediction
After running the script, you can input specific features, and the model will predict the corresponding credit score.
